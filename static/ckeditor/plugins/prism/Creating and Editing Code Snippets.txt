CKEditor Prism Highlighter Plugin


I. CREATING NEW PRISM CODE SNIPPET

1.) Click the Code Snippet icon in the CKEditor Toolbar. The Dialog window will now pop-up.
2.) Select the language that will be the basis for the syntax highlighting.
3.) Input the code snippets to be highlighted.
4.) Click the OK button.


II. EDITING EXISTING PRISM CODE SNIPPET

Just double-click the target code snippet block and its dialog window will pop-up.
This happens since a code snippet is implemented as a widget in which by default
has a mask/wrapper covering the entire widget block so that you could click in
any part of it.


Note that you could also copy and paste the existing code snippets for faster workflow
since it will be already set in your desired programming language and you will just
need to edit/set the contents.
