<strong>OVERVIEW</strong>:<br>
<a href="http://ckeditor.com/addon/prism">Prism Highlighter</a> is a plugin for <a href="http://ckeditor.com">CKEditor</a> for inserting beautiful formatted text, markdown, or code snippets in your blog or website. Prism is the chosen renderer/highlighter/colorizer since it's pretty, lightweight, and extendable. I also use this plugin in my [personal website](http://www.ranelpadon.com/content/practical-regex-part-12-common-operators).

This plugin utilizes the following libraries: <br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://ckeditor.com/addon/codesnippet">CKEditor Code Snippet Plugin</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://docs.ckeditor.com/#!/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.codesnippet.highlighter">CKEditor Code Snippet API</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://prismjs.com/">Prism Syntax Highlighter with Dark Theme</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://prismjs.com/plugins/line-numbers/">Prism Line Numbers Add-on</a></li>
</ul>

By default, Prism has no line numbering mechanism, so the **Line Number** add-on has been added. Also, in order for the line numbers to work smoothly in CKEditor and when rendering the actual page, I did some minor patching in **prism.js** and **prism.css**.
